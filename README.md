# Full Stack open - Part 3

This repo is for the exercises of the [Full Stack open](https://fullstackopen.com/en), specifically [Part 3](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3).

This is not my first back end project, so did not learn much from this one to be honest :)

The application can be found [here](https://obscure-oasis-12065.herokuapp.com/api/persons), but right now it only responds to API calls.

The corresponding front-end can be found [here](https://github.com/emrergin/fullstackopen/tree/main/part2/phonebook).
